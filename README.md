Python coding of Data Smart (John W. Foreman) projects

As part of my journey into Data Science I am reading Data Smart. This book gives data for projects in excel. In order to up my python game and explore data science principles I will attempt to complete the projects by writing python programs for each of them. Should be fun and challenging. 

Janurary 26, 2017: Completed first project in DataSmart. Analysis of customer purchases from a wine import-export business. Hypethetical company tracks email newsleter offers and purchases by customer name. The goal was to analyse the purchases using K-means cluster analysis to group the customer base and generate customized emails to each segment. The offer information and transactions per customer were provided. The SKmeans.py program is able to read in this data and preform a spherical Kmeans clustering with user input cluster number. The user can then request analysis of which deals were prefered in each cluster. During the example analysis of WineKMC.xlsx data with spherical Kmeans clustering K=5, there are clear customer groups that prefer: 1) Offers from France, 2) Pinot Noir offers, 3) minimum quantity offers (6 kg), 4) Champagne or Prosecco offers, 5) large quantity offers (72 or 144kg).
