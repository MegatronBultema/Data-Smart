# Data-Smart
Python coding of Data Smart (John W. Foreman) projects

As part of my journey into Data Science I am reading Data Smart. This book gives data for projects in excel. In order to up my python game and explore data science principles I will attempt to complete the projects by writing python programs for each of them. Should be fun and challenging.
